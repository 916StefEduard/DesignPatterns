# DesignPatterns
1) Command Pattern = is a data driven pattern and falls under behavioral patten category.A request is wrapped under an object as commnad and passed to invoker object.
2) Factory Design Pattern = we create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to the newly created object using a common interface.
3) Singleton Design Pattern = a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that one single object gets created.
4) Builder Pattern = a builder class builds the final object step by step. The builder is independent of other objects
5) Adapter Pattern = works as a bridge between two incompatible interface to make them work together
6) MVC Pattern = stand for Model-View-Controller Pattern (Model - represents an object with attributes, Controller-is an inner repository, View-the interface of the program)
7) Observer Pattern = is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically.
8) Memento Pattern = is used to restore the state of an object to a previous state.
9) Proxy design Pattern = we create an object having original object to interface its functionality to outer world


# Object Oriented Programming Questions:
1. operator (parameters).
2. compile time polymorphism(different implementations of the same function a couple times in a row).
3. friend class = class which can access the private and protected members of another class in which it is declared as friend.

# Object Oriented Programming Principles
1. Encapsulation = restricting direct access to an object component
2. Abstraction = hiding details of a certain work 
3. Inheritance = one class inherites

Static variable in Java = is essentially a global variable shared among all of the class
Static method in Java = function that has some restrictions like restricted access to variables or other functions
                        that are not static.
Static Class in Java = used only inside another class and has restricted access to variables that are not static from the
                        outside class.
